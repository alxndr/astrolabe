# Quick Astro Charts

A webapp for quickly creating and displaying Western astrological charts. The chart is drawn immediately, if the time or place is not specified determines current time and place and updates every second automatically. Optimized for displaying on screens of any size and usage in digital signage. Uses only most established and verified astrology concepts.
